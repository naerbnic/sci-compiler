SC 4.100 
	
 Reverted back to previous version of compiler. The current compiler
 works with &rest in the revised way('92), while the changed compiler
 worked with &rest in the original way('87).

 For clarification on &rest:

	if call (func 1 2 3 4 5)
 	
	(procedure (func a b c)
		(func2 a b &rest c)	 ;; will pass 1 2 4 5 3 to func2
	
		(func2 a b (&rest c)) ;; will pass 1 2 3 4 5 to func2
	)
